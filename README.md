# Skip Hire Selector - Design Guide

## Design Approach

This component helps customers choose skip sizes with a focus on **simplicity**, **trust**, and **mobile-first experience**.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Horizontal Scroll Layout

**Why**: Better for mobile users and easier comparison shopping

- Less overwhelming than a grid of options

### 2. Consolidated Header/Filter Bar

**Why**: Saves space and puts help where users expect it

- Reduces scrolling on mobile
- Help button is easily accessible when confused
- Clean, organized layout

### 3. Modal Help System

**Why**: Doesn't interrupt the selection flow

- Users keep their place while learning
- Better use of mobile screen space
- Optional - doesn't slow down confident users
